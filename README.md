# SmartenitZBMLC30
Hubitat driver for Smart Enit ZBML30 dual 220V Zigbee relay.


Add both .groovy files to your Hubitat Drivers.
Select the device driver after you have paired the ZBMLC30 to your Hubitat Zigbee network
Initialize the parent
Go to the new child device, select if it is switch one or switch two.  ( I made this a "feature" because I wanted to be able to change which relay was activated from the child so I wouldn't have to break automations in NodeRed and HassIO )
Away you go.....
